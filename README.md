# SimpleWeather!

This is a refactored version of the SimpleWeather app and has extended what I submitted to Udacity for my final project of the nanodegree.

Uses RealmSwift to persist weather data across launches.

Uses Material to animate transitions between View Controllers.

Uses SwiftLint to enforce good coding style.
